# Wordle

Revitalized the classic game Wordle through the implementation of Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This engaging application seamlessly connects to an endpoint accessed by an API, tapping into an extensive words dictionary to provide users with challenging yet enjoyable word-guessing experiences along with corresponding hints. Going beyond the traditional gameplay, the site offers enhanced features such as dynamic light mode and dark mode options, catering to user preferences for a personalized visual experience. Additionally, a sliding sidebar has been incorporated, serving as an interactive hub that showcases comprehensive instructions on how to navigate and fully enjoy the game. This project not only breathes new life into a beloved game but also showcases a thoughtful integration of modern design elements to enhance user engagement and enjoyment.

Note: a local dictionary was implemented due to the API being disconnecteed.
